            <h4> Scars, Acne, Moles?</h4>
            <p>As your body’s first line of defense, your skin takes a lot of hits. Not only is it the largest organ in your body, but your skin also protects you from germs; repels water; and covers your blood vessels, nerves, and organs. If you aren’t feeling good about the skin you’re in or are worried about something on your skin, you should consider seeing a dermatologist.</p>
            <h4>7 Reasons to See a Dermatologist</h4>
            <h5>1. A mole or patch of skin that's changed</h5>
            <p>If a mole or patch of your skin has changed in color, size, shape, or symptom you better see a dermatologist. Such changes like those are often signs of skin cancer, and when it comes to cancer you want treatment sooner rather than later. Your dermatologist can also help you learn how to do regular skin checkups or screenings.</p>
            <h5>2. Stubborn acne</h5>
            <p>You’ve tried over-the-counter products, fad diets, and cleanses, but your acne is still front and center. There is no shame is seeing a dermatologist to help you deal with this skin condition. Get some recommendations on how to put your best face forward.</p>

            <h5>4. Scars from acne, blemishes, or cuts and scrapes</h5>
            <p>If your scar is looking less than desirable, a dermatologist could help you. Medical techniques like laser treatment therapy, microdermabrasion, and others can reduce scarring. With the treatment options available today, there is no need to feel self-conscious.</p>
            <h5> 5. Persistent skin irritation</h5>
            <p> You have itchy, red, flaky skin and over-the-counter creams and lotions just aren’t working. You may think that the cause of your dry skin is the weather, sensitivity to skincare products, or even genetics. But in reality, you could have a chronic skin condition.</p>
            <h5>6. Nail disorders, ingrown nails, fungus, or others</h5>
            <p>Whether you are getting treatment for an ingrown nail, a fungal infection, wart, or something else, having a dermatologist look over your nails is a good thing. Nails can show signs of other body disorders like liver disease, heart conditions, anemia, or diabetes.</p>

            <p> Noticed more hair than usual on your pillow in the morning? You may have a scalp disorder or want to start some preventive therapies before your hair loss makes a bigger impact on your life.
